# Contributing to Flaps

Flaps is currently in **pre-alpha**. The repository is public from day one to make the design discussion visible, but the public API is not stable yet. The information below describes the conventions that will apply once the project opens for contributions.

## Conventions

Flaps follows the Nubster general coding standards documented in [nubster-docs](https://github.com/nubster-opensources/nubster-docs/tree/main/docs/reference/coding-standards). In short:

- **Trunk-Based Development**, feature branches `feature/<issue>-<slug>` from `main`, never commit directly on `main`.
- **Conventional Commits**, all commit messages follow the `type(scope): description` format, enforced by `cog verify` in the commit-msg hook.
- **Rust style**, workspace lints `clippy::all` and `clippy::pedantic` set to `deny`, MSRV pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` and `Cargo.toml`.
- **No competitor mentions**, the source code, commit messages, pull requests and documentation never name competing tools or services.
- **English on the public API, French on internal artifacts**, rustdoc comments and public types are written in English; commit messages, issues and project documentation are written in French.
- **No vendor lock-in**, every external integration (auth, events, audit) goes through an open standard (OIDC, SCIM, CloudEvents, HMAC). Nubster Identity and Hexeract are the default convenient options, never a hard dependency.

## Local setup (when the project opens)

```bash
# Pin the Rust toolchain via rustup
rustup show

# Install the commit-msg hook (runs cog verify on every commit)
cog install-hook commit-msg

# Local checks before pushing
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

## Discussion before code

Until v0.1.0, all design decisions go through a `discussion/` thread on the repository before any pull request is opened. This includes the public traits, the evaluation engine contracts, the compiler pipeline, the store schema and the OFREP API surface.
